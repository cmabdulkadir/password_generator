Password Generator 


In this project I created an application that assists empoloyee's in generating a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying the starter code. As an employee with sensitive data, this application is designed to create a strong password that provides a greater security. This application will run in the browser, and will feature a dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive and adapts to multiple screen sizes.
